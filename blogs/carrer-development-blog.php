                        <p style="padding:10px 0 0 0">Some of us are drawn to specific career paths from a young age. For others, choosing a career
                            can be a slightly more complex matter.<br>The sheer number of different options can be
                            overwhelming, with the fear of making the wrong career choice very real. This variety also
                            means, however, that it’s highly likely that there will an ideal job out there for everyone.
                            It’s just a matter of identifying the correct career path and taking the first steps.</p>


                        <p>There are many ways to strengthen logical thinking in your daily work. Here are a few methods
                            you might consider to develop your logical thinking skills: <br>

                            1. Conduct a self-assessment <br>
                            2. Match potential career paths <br>
                            3. Narrow down the options <br>
                            4. Make a plan of action <br>
                        </p>

                        <p><b><big>1. Conduct a self-assessment</big></b><br>
                            The first step to choosing a career is to understand your own skills, interests, and
                            ambitions.<br>Establishing these will give you some much-needed clarity. Understanding your
                            own desires
                            and abilities is a big step towards choosing a career. <br>Speak to colleagues, friends, and
                            others who know you in different capacities. They will be
                            able to give you insights into yourself of which you may well not be aware. Don’t be afraid
                            to ask about your weaknesses too. Understanding the wrong career environment will help you
                            narrow down the right one. Think about how you like to work. <br>Your interests are a key
                            determinant of the sorts of jobs which you’d enjoy. A job at which you’re great but in which
                            you are uninterested may leave you feeling unfulfilled.

                        </p>

                        <p><b><big>2. Match potential career paths</big></b><br>
                            The next step is matching your skills, interests, and career goals with potential career
                            paths.
                            <br>The answer may be staring you in the face. Bring together the above elements, and you
                            may find that they point to a very specific career path. Consult others as well, they may
                            see patterns you don’t. <br>Look through jobs boards and listings online and see what sort
                            of job vacancies resonate with your career profile. Hopefully, the self-assessment exercise
                            will help you narrow this down a little bit. You can also carry out career-related keyword
                            searches to see what comes up. There’s plenty of careerscontent out there as well, so do
                            some reading.
                        </p>

                        <p><b><big>3. Narrow down the options</big></b><br>
                            Now it’s time to refine this list. You need to weigh up the pros and cons of each career
                            path. <br>If possible, speak to people who currently work in the field. Ask around to see if
                            there’s anyone in your wider network. If not, make use of online forums or LinkedIn to get
                            in touch to ask (politely) if those working in related jobs can answer a few questions.
                            Again, careers content can help shed some light on various career paths. <br>Careers with a
                            high level of buy-in, involving specific training, will also require a tighter focus.</p>

                        <p><b><big>4. Make a plan of action</big></b><br>
                            The last step of choosing a new career path is to think about the steps you’ll be taking
                            along it. <br>Here you need to think about long and short-term career goals, working from
                            where you are now to where you ultimately want to be. <br>

                            Short-term career goals should be very specific and set along a specific timeline. If you
                            need to put your CV in order, set yourself a deadline. If you need to enrol on a course,
                            look at application deadlines and completion dates. If you’re ready to apply for positions,
                            set yourself a minimum threshold of applications to make this week or month. <br>Be
                            realistic but ambitious. If the timescales you set are too short, you risk getting
                            disheartened by missing goals. On the other hand, a little bit of urgency will help you
                            build up some momentum. Be realistic in your expectations. If it’s a new career path, you’ll
                            have to train and work in entry-level positions, or even complete internships. Career
                            gratification is rarely instant.<br>This should give you an idea of where you can expect to
                            be when. If your career journey is a longer one, understanding that you are progressing will
                            be heartening. <br>Also map longer-term career goals. If there are more steps on your career
                            journey, these might include getting your first position or earning required qualifications.
                            <br>A degree of flexibility may be necessary. Perhaps things may not work out as you expect in
                            your career plan. There is the very real possibility of facing setbacks along the way. Where
                            possible you should include some backup options. There are multiple routes along any given
                            career path – or you may want to find a new one altogether. Your priorities or passions may
                            change as you progress. You may become aware of alternative options.
