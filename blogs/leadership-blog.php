                <p>Company leaders are facing a crisis. Nearly one-third of employees don’t trust management. In
                    addition to this, employers now have to cater to the needs of the millennial generation. On
                    average, after graduating from college, a millennial will change jobs four times before they
                    are 32. Most of them also don’t feel empowered on their current jobs.</p>


                <p>It’s clear that many leaders are failing to foster a sense of trust and loyalty in their
                    employees. Fortunately, that doesn’t have to be the case. Managers who show great leadership
                    qualities can inspire their teams to accomplish amazing things, according to Daniel Wang,
                    the creator of Loopring Protocol and founder of the Loopring Foundation. Loopring is a
                    decentralized automated execution system that trades across the crypto-token exchanges. The
                    platform reduces the cost of trading and shields users from counterparty risk. I’ve
                    distilled my conversation with Wang to eight of the most essential qualities that make a
                    great leader..</p>

                <p><b><big>1. Sincere enthusiasm</big></b><br>
                    True enthusiasm for a business, its products, and its mission cannot be faked. Employees can
                    recognize insincere cheerleading from a mile away. However, when leaders are sincerely
                    enthusiastic and passionate, that’s contagious. For instance, someone who worked with Elon
                    Musk on the early stages of his SpaceX project said that the true driver behind the success
                    of the project was Musk’s enthusiasm for space travel.</p>

                <p><b><big>2. Integrity</big></b><br>
                    Whether it’s giving proper credit for accomplishments, acknowledging mistakes, or putting
                    safety and quality first, great leaders exhibit integrity at all times. They do what’s
                    right, even if that isn’t the best thing for the current project or even the bottom line.
                </p>

                <p><b><big>3. Great communication skills</big></b><br>
                    Leaders must motivate, instruct and discipline the people they are in charge of. They can
                    accomplish none of these things if they aren’t very skilled communicators. Not only that,
                    poor communication can lead to poor outcomes. Leaders who fail to develop these skills are
                    often perceived as being weak and mealy-mouthed, according to Wang. It’s also important to
                    remember that listening is an integral part of communication.</p>

                <p><b><big>4. Loyalty</big></b><br>
                    The best leaders understand that true loyalty is reciprocal. Because of this, they express
                    that loyalty in tangible ways that benefit the member of their teams. True loyalty is
                    ensuring that all team members have the training and resources to do their jobs. It’s
                    standing up for team members in crisis and conflict.</p>

                <p><b><big>5. Decisiveness</big></b><br>
                    A good leader isn’t simply empowered to make decisions due to their position. They are
                    willing to take on the risk of decision making. They make these decisions and take risks
                    knowing that if things don’t work out, they’ll need to hold themselves accountable first and
                    foremost.<br>Further, bosses who aren’t decisive are often ineffective. Too much effort
                    working on consensus building can have a negative effect. Rather than simply making a
                    decision, many leaders allow debate to continue, and then create a piecemeal decision that
                    satisfies no one.</p>

                <p><b><big>6. Managerial competence</big></b><br>
                    Too many organizations try to create leaders from people who are simply good at their jobs.
                    To be clear, those who emerge as being very good workers often have important qualities.
                    They are the ones who have a strong understanding of the company’s products and services.
                    They understand company goals, processes, and procedures. All of these are important.On the
                    other hand, being good at one’s job doesn’t prove that someone possesses the other
                    competencies they need.</p>

                <p><b><big>7. Empowerment</big></b><br>
                    good leader has faith in their ability to train and develop the employees under them.
                    Because of this, they have the willingness to empower those they lead to act autonomously.
                    Wang says this comes from trusting that their team members are fully up to any challenges
                    they face. When employees are empowered, they are more likely to make decisions that are in
                    the best interest of the company and the customer as well. This is true, even if it means
                    allowing workers to go a bit off script.</p>

                <p><b><big>8. Charisma</big></b><br>
                    Simply put, people are more likely to follow the lead of those they like. The best leaders
                    are well-spoken, approachable and friendly. They show sincere care for others.</p>
